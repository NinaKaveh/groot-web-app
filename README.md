## Description

This is the participative platform, Groot, with which students and employees of ISEP, a digital engineering school, will be able to follow environmental news and hence play a role, at their own level, in a context of ecological transition. 

This project aims to increase the number of participants in events related to ecology, and more generally to sustainable development.  

The platform will guarantee a permanent reliability with information coming from members of the school, and will be controlled by an administrator.  

The aim is that the platform will be entertaining, by letting members contribute to the flow of information themselves, while challenging its members with a system of trophies for each relevant publication or participation. 
Groot is not only the first platform for interactive participation in environmental news, it is also itself a full participant in this ecological aspect, thanks to the green code, as well as an eco-friendly management of its servers.
